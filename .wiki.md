# Project Summary
The OVPN Client project has transitioned from a Python GTK4 application to a C language implementation using GTK3 and AppIndicator. This new version focuses on providing a lightweight and efficient graphical interface for managing OpenVPN configurations and connections, integrating seamlessly with NetworkManager. By eliminating Python dependencies, the project aims to enhance performance and reduce the overall binary size, making it easier to deploy and use.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of the following functional modules:
- **OVPNImporter**: The main application that provides the GUI for importing and managing OpenVPN connections.
- **Connection Management**: Handles the creation, deletion, and connection of VPN profiles using the NetworkManager API.
- **Configuration Parsing**: Parses `.ovpn` configuration files to extract necessary parameters and validate certificates.

# File Description Inventory
- **build_c.sh**: A script to build the OVPN Client for C, ensuring all dependencies are met and bundled correctly.
- **install_c.sh**: A script for installing the built application system-wide and creating a desktop entry.
- **ovpn-client.desktop**: A desktop entry file for integrating the application into the desktop environment.
- **dist/**: Contains the built executable files generated by the build script.
- **Makefile**: A file for managing the build process using make.
- **ovpn_client.c**: The main C source file implementing the OVPN Client functionality.

# Technology Stack
- **C**: Programming language used for development.
- **GTK 3**: Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **AppIndicator**: For system tray integration.
- **NetworkManager**: To manage VPN connections.

# Usage
To build and run the OVPN Client, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the necessary system packages installed.
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build_c.sh
   ./build_c.sh
   ```
3. After building, install the application:
   ```bash
   ./install_c.sh
   ```
4. You can now run the application from your terminal or find it in your applications menu.
