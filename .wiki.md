# Project Summary
The OVPN Client is a simplified OpenVPN client GUI application built using C and GTK3. It allows users to import and parse .ovpn configuration files, display the analysis of these configurations, and manage VPN connections through a simple graphical interface. This project focuses on providing a user-friendly way to handle OpenVPN configurations while being cross-platform compatible, particularly for Linux systems.

# Project Module Description
The OVPN Client consists of the following functional modules:
- **Configuration Import**: Allows users to import OpenVPN configuration files (.ovpn) for parsing.
- **Configuration Analysis**: Displays the parsed configuration details, including remote servers, authentication methods, and other settings.
- **Logging**: Maintains a log of actions and errors for debugging purposes.
- **VPN Management**: Provides a simplified interface for testing connections and displaying connection statuses.
